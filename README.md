B.tech Ransomware Detection System Based on Machine Learning Project


### Abstract 

Every day, there is great growth of the Internet and smart devices connected to the network. Additionally, there is an increasing number of malwares that attack networks, devices, system and applications. One of the biggest threats and newest attacks in cybersecurity is Ransom Software (Ransomware). Although there is a lot of research on detecting malware using machine learning (ML), only a few focus on ML-based ransomware detection, especially attacks targeting smartphone operating systems (e.g., Android) and applications. In this research, a new system was proposed to protect smartphones from malicious applications through monitoring network traffic. So Machine Learning algorithms are applied and it comes it this is best method for the work.
